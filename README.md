# **Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction**

## **Background & Motivation**
Chronic Kidney Disease (**CKD**) poses a substantial healthcare burden globally due to its rising prevalence, potential progression to end-stage renal disease, and poor prognosis. Unhealthy dietary habits and inadequate water intake contribute significantly to CKD. With kidneys being crucial for survival, early prediction is essential.

This study utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically **logistic regression**, to predict CKD status using clinical data. The methodology involves **data preprocessing, handling missing values, aggregation, and feature extraction**. Early diagnosis aids in potential rectification, and the motivation is to predict renal disease by analyzing key indicators using three machine learning classification approaches, ultimately selecting the one with the highest accuracy rate.

## **Problem Statement**
Machine learning models present the capability to analyze vast healthcare datasets, unveiling intricate patterns and identifying elusive risk factors that traditional methods may overlook. These algorithms are adept at predicting an individual's risk of developing **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** by scrutinizing health records and lifestyle factors. Predictive features include **blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, age, and medical history**. Additionally, machine learning models can broaden their analysis to encompass additional variables such as **genetic factors and lifestyle choices**, providing a comprehensive approach to assessing and predicting disease risk.

## **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Checking** for null values and duplicate values in the dataset and processing them using suitable methods.
- **Encoding** categorical data using *One-Hot Encoding*.
- **Encoding** the dependent variable using *Label Encoding*.

## **Data Splitting**
- Splitting the data into **training and testing sets** in a **70:30 ratio**.
- Importing the required libraries for model training and evaluation.

## **Logistic Regression**
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for **binary classification problems**. It estimates the probability of an outcome occurring based on input features. In this study, **logistic regression** is applied to predict CKD status.

## **Conclusion**
The study concludes that **logistic regression** is a highly accurate method for predicting **chronic kidney disease**, with a **precision of 78.75% and an accuracy of 79%**. Notably, these models **outperform prior research**, indicating increased reliability. **Cross-validation measurements** confirm logistic regression's superior performance in predicting CKD compared to other methods.

### **Future Scope**
Future research can extend this work by:
- Developing a **web application** incorporating these algorithms.
- Utilizing a **larger dataset** to enhance accuracy.
- Enabling healthcare practitioners to **anticipate kidney issues more efficiently**.

The aim is to **improve reliability, encourage early treatment for chronic renal disease, and promote positive lifestyle changes**.
